	  		<h2> Skill Training </h2>
	  		<p>		Zwilling Foundation India, to make differently abled and marginalized women self-reliant, imparts vocational training and also gives stipend to encourage more women to learn tailoring. This program which was started in 2011 was streamlined by including more advanced levels. All the candidates would be given training for one year or till they become capable. Entire syllabus was divided into 4 modules and stipend varies based on the module they are learning. If some candidates are not capable enough to learn the advanced levels, they will be retained in the same level till they complete training period. Everyone will be enrolled in basic level module and will be promoted based on their performance.</p>

			<p>It works to help differently abled children and women to lead a normal life by providing services like early identification, intervention, education, vocational training, employment opportunities and providing aids and appliances. By sponsoring education and by providing vocational training, it works to open opportunities for differently abled and marginalized children and women. Zwilling at present works with 34 children and 23 women and is aspiring to include more vocational trainings and reach needier.  Zwilling is not restricted when it comes to helping differently abled and would like to take extra steps to help them lead economically independent and normal life. </p>

			<p>		To develop self-confidence by giving hands on experience to trainees, Zwilling foundation India has included job work section, where towels, aprons and leather pouches are stitched and supplied to Tweezerman India to further sent to Germany. This year because of the inclusion of advanced level training we have received garment stitching orders and trainees got good exposure in stitching fashion garments. At present Foundation supports 8 differently abled and marginalized women by procuring job work orders and provides livelihood. This year we have added one new product (purse) to our list. We have made 98972 towels, 43215 leather pouches, 427 aprons, 1000 purses and approximately 100 garments. </p>
